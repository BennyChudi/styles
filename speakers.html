                            just have to get started.&#8221;</q><br> I would love to share what i&#8217;ve learnt 
                        about
                            our generation and the world we&#8217;re building together.<br> I&#8217;m here to tell
                        you
                            that finding your purpose isn&#8217;t enough! Purpose is that feeling that you are a 
                        part 
                            of something bigger than yourself; that you are needed, and that you have something better
                        ahead
                            to work for. Purpose is what creates true happiness. The greatest challenge of our generation
                        is
                            to build a world where everybody has a sense of purpose&#8230;
